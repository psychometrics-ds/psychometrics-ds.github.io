## Areas of Expertise

RESEARCH INTERESTS

My research interests center around two main areas. The first area focuses on latent variable modeling and structural equation modeling. I am currently developing a partially confirmatory approach to both frameworks with multiple research directions and potential applications. The estimation algorithm presents a significant challenge that I aim to overcome.

The second area is the integration of psychometrics with NLP. I am exploring different approaches to combine large language models with psychometrics, which can be applied in various educational and psychological domains. One potential application I am investigating is to improve STEM learning with NLP-generated educational contents such as knowledge, solutions, and examples.
